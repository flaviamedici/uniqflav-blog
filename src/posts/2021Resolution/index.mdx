excerpt: New Year, New Me. Or I should say, new goals and challenges. I have two small challenges that I am getting ready for in 2021.

#### New Year, new life right?

I've chosen to participate in two new year’s challenges, the first one is the Manifesting Challenge by 
Gabby Bernstein (You can check it out [here]( https://gabbybernstein.com/)), and the second one is the 30 Day Yoga Journey by Adriene from the YouTube channel [Yoga with Adriene](https://yogawithadriene.com/).

I must admit that I like the excitement of a new year and I also like to set goals for myself every start of the year. Since last years was a little bit uncertain, I’ve decided to pick two things that I am able to do at home and hey won’t last more than 30 days so that is helpful to keep me accountable.
